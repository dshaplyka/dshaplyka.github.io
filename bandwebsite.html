Guitar, 25keys MIDI Keyboard (3 hours ago - Present)
Devin Min is technically a guitarist of “Bandname” since the html session 3 hours ago. Min used to work toward specializing in jazz guitar, but he soon switched his mind to EPD after a month at Berklee college of music.
    <br/>

He has been a member of his high school big band for 2 years. His interest these days is writing for media and games, he was lucky to take part in his first indie game scoring gig which will be released early next year.
    <br/>
    
Min’s favorite artists include Madeon, Snail’s house, Anomalie, Chris Larkin, Lena Raine and many more.
